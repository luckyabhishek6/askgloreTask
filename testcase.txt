Test Case: Creating and Transferring ERC721 Tokens

Deploy ERC721 and ERC20 contracts.
Create an ERC721 token using the createToken function and associate it with 1000 ERC20 tokens.
Verify that the ERC721 token is created successfully and associated with the correct amount of ERC20 tokens.
Transfer the ERC721 token to another account using the transferERC721 function.
Verify that the token transfer is successful and ownership is updated.

Test Case: Transferring ERC20 Tokens

Deploy ERC721 and ERC20 contracts.
Create an ERC721 token using the createToken function and associate it with 1000 ERC20 tokens.
Transfer the associated ERC20 tokens to another account using the transferERC20 function.
Verify that the ERC20 tokens are successfully transferred and the balances are updated accordingly.

Test Case: Querying ERC20 Token Amount for an ERC721 Token

Deploy ERC721 and ERC20 contracts.
Create an ERC721 token using the createToken function and associate it with 1000 ERC20 tokens.
Query the associated ERC20 token amount for the ERC721 token using the getTokenERC20Amount function.
Verify that the returned ERC20 token amount matches the expected value.

Test Case: Error Handling

Deploy ERC721 and ERC20 contracts.
Attempt to associate ERC20 tokens with a non-existing ERC721 token using the associateERC20 function.
Verify that an appropriate error is thrown, preventing the association of tokens with non-existing tokens.

Test Case: Minting and Distributing ERC20 Tokens

Deploy ERC721 and ERC20 contracts.
Create an ERC721 token using the createToken function.
Mint a specific amount of ERC20 tokens using the mint function in the ERC20 contract.
Distribute the minted ERC20 tokens to specific accounts using the transferERC20 function.
Verify that the ERC20 tokens are successfully minted and distributed to the intended accounts.
